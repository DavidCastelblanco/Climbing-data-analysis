# Climbing data analysis
Comparison of height, weight and body mass index between average climbers and strong climbers (climbed above 5.14a)


My goal with this project is to compare some physical characteristics of average climbers vs climbers that I have called 'strong', who have climbed at least once above grade 5.14a.


For this project was used a DAVID COHEN database, which is found in kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook)


The database was extracted in sqlite format, then was put in csv format for cleaning and analysis in SQL.


In this repository you can find the csc files product of the queries made in SQL (postgres), as well as the queries made to the database. If anyone is interested in the initial database you can contact me. It has not been uploaded to the repository due to the size of the file, more than 4 million records were analyzed.


The graphic results of the queries were made in tableau and can be found at the following link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.gerardo.castelblanco.prieto/viz/Climbingdata/Results?publish=yes
